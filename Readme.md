## Introduction

This project is a small 2D maze game about a famous German composer of the late Baroque period and his (more or less) musical antics. It uses the MLX42 graphics library (a Codam-developed derivative of the earlier MiniLibX library).

### Compiling

Make sure to also fetch the `libft`, `libftprintf` and `MLX42` submodules. Having done that, the game can be compiled by invoking `make` in the repository's root.
