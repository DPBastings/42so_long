Urgent:
# Implement opening and closing screens.
# Split the so_long.h header into smaller headers. Sensibly, if at all possible.
## sl_graphics.h
## sl_engine.h
## so_long.h (things like GRID_H/_W)
# Make it so that enemy sprites no longer cut off one another.

Not-so-urgent:

# Make the object tick function pointer a struct member.
# Expand the writer to be able to work with non-monospace fonts too.
# Make the walls a little more beautiful. There's only 12 + 4 = 16 more configurations to go.

Far from urgent:

# Add more levels!
