Urgent:
# Split the so_long.h header into smaller headers. Sensibly, if at all possible.
# Merge the mlx42_* headers.
# Restructure the HUD builders, so that there's 1 main function for every component which both builds and renders
the component.
# Do something about corner walls. Preferably without requiring 256 different wall sprites.
# Move the movement key check into the player tick function.
# Refactor the mlx42_utils functions to work with uint32_t pointers more.
# Create a 'font options' struct, containing at least `size` and `colour` members.

Not-so-urgent:

# Make the object tick function pointer a struct member.
# Expand the writer to be able to work with non-monospace fonts too.
